# Chapter 2
This chapter covers the next 2 usernames in the series:
- SS2k went missing again
- Fury of the lost SS2k

## The Facts
SS2k is lost, and angry. There's not much else to these 2 usernames. Or is there? This is the *second* time SS2K has gone missing. This could mean anything from the fact that SS2k's neighborhood is EXTREMELY unsafe to the fact that he lives in a posh mansion.

## Why did SS2k go missing?

### Theory 1: Lost
The first is the most vague but most plausible theory. In essence, it states that SS2k is a curious child/person, who gets lost. 

### Theory 2: Kidnapped
This theory is essentially that SS2k has been kidnapped for ransom. It also means that SS2k's parents have a fair deal of money.

### Theory 3: Running
SS2k could also have run away from home. For what reason? Nobody knows...

## Why is SS2k angry?
Well of course, he could just be frustrated. But, when combined with the first username, it is quite possible to conclude that SS2k is angry at his kidnapper. He could also be angry at his family. Thus, the **Kidnapped** and **Running** theories now have quite a solid piece of evidence!
