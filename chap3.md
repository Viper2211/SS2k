# Chapter 3
This chapter covers the next 2 usernames in the series:
- The lost SS2k chopped off a toe
- Content of the lost SS2k

## The Facts
These two usernames give us a few hints that can only be confirmed by the next usernames. When viewed seperately, the make little to no sense, but when viewed together, you can start to see where this story is headed. SS2k has chopped off his toe, and he's *glad* about it! Not what you would expect right? This either means that SS2k has gone crazy, was already crazy from the start.

## Why did SS2k cut off his toe?

### Theory 1: Crazy
SS2k could also have run away from home. Now that we now that SS2k **is** crazy, we can conclude that he's just a child with serious problems. This leads onto a **whole new** set of questions: Why is he like this?, What happened to him?, Will he ever get back?

### Theory 2: Driven Insane
But what if SS2k didn't want to do this in the beginning? Maybe, just maybe, he was kidnapped and put through all kinds of torture, to the point where he was drive crazy. It fits with the idea that SS2k is this irresponsible kid who was messing around outside when he shouldn't have been. 

### Theory 3: Sci-fi?
The third and most farfetched theory: SS2k is being controlled by someone/something else. This is quite vague, but it's all we can say for sure now.
