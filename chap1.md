# Chapter 1
This chapter covers the first 3 usernames in the series:
- SS2K
- SS2k went missing
- return of SS2K

## The Facts
These 3 usernames lay down a solid foundation for the rest of the plot. You can think of the first username as a exposition, and the other two as a minor conflict. But why do these three pieces of data matter? Well, they suggest that SS2K, our beloved main character, has a tendency of running away from home / going missing. 

## Questions
There is a question whether or not these may actually affect the plot. **The Author** directly contacted me, saying that these usernames were only intended to "...announce the break, so \[they\] just put it in with the storyline"

However, they may prove to be useful pieces of evidence in later theories.
